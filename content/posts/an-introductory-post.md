Hello - 

Bear with me since this is my first blog post. I’ll try to keep it short and sweet. 

My name is Mason. I’m a creative living in Chicago. I use the vague word “creative” here because I’m a bit of a Jack of all trades, master of none. Basically, my ideas to output ratio is very low (likely as a result of my ADHD). A lot of different mediums resonate with me, but I have trouble seeing things through. Obviously I’m learning to change that, and I even independently released my first EP of produced music a couple of months ago! It’s all a work in progress. 

I’ll likely be posting my thoughts, ideas and other things here. I have a wide variety of interests so you’ll likely see a bit of everything from music production, visual art, graphic design (my day job), ADHD talk, Apple hardware/software and more. 

Really, whatever catches my eye and is too long for other platforms is fair game. 

You can find me on the [Fediverse](https://mas.to/@msnws) for shorter thoughts. Additionally, [here’s a link my music](linktr.ee/violetnoise). I’ll eventually have my portfolio site up, but it’s under construction so no point in that right now. 

Until next time!
