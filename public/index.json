[{"content":"Just as a note\u0026hellip; I mention incredibly light spoilers for the end of Veep, and less light spoilers for Game of Thrones below.\nJust finished watching Veep yesterday. I liked it a lot. The middle seasons (3-5) were probably my favorite and have a lot of the same charm that a lot of other ensemble cast shows I\u0026rsquo;ve loved (The Office, Parks \u0026amp; Rec, etc.) had back in the day.\nThe beginning of the show took some time to grow on me, I think the humor moving so quickly makes for sort of a mental adjustment, but once you get into the swing of things and sort of understand the pacing the show goes for, the comedy starts to land pretty excellently. And there were a ton of genuine laugh-out-loud moments during my watch-through.\nThat said, I have some criticisms for sure\u0026hellip;\nI\u0026rsquo;ve seen talk online about the final two seasons of Veep being the worst, with many people saying that season 6 was the worst of them all. I disagree. I enjoyed season 6 even though I admit it was very different. In contrast, I actually found season 7 to be pretty disappointing. So much so, that I actually feel like it\u0026rsquo;s approaching Game of Thrones-ending territory. While the final scene in the show sticks its landing really well, almost everything leading up to it was immeasurably difficult to get through.\nAlmost every character had been Flanderized to the point of no-return in season 7, and the pacing of the season itself was miserable. What\u0026rsquo;s more, given th e general tone of the show, the Flanderization logically plays up each character\u0026rsquo;s extremely negative traits. Season 7 reduces each character to a single trait (sociopathic Selina, big oaf Mike, sex-addict Dan, crazy Amy, fascist(????) Jonah, stupid Richard).\nWhile it was made clear at the outset of the show that the characters were not good people by any stretch of the imagination, earlier seasons always did a good job of making them appear human in spite of their terribleness. Yes, Selina is a raging narcissist and outright terrible person, but the show balanced these moments by showing her, on occasion, reeling from the consequences of her actions and suffering in relatable, yet deserved ways.\nIn the final season, much like Game of Thrones\u0026rsquo; Daenerys, Selina becomes corrupted by her desire for power and throws every last shred of her humanity away in a matter of episodes. While Game of Thrones should have approached this change in character over the course of several seasons, Veep could have gotten away with it in one, it\u0026rsquo;s just that season 7 was both already shortened and had immense pacing problems. And unfortunately, this same concept more or less applies to every character in the show (I could probably write an entire thesis on how poorly they handled Jonah\u0026rsquo;s character towards the end).\nObviously, I watched this show outside of the time period it aired, so the cultural and political climate, things that were both immensely informative to the show\u0026rsquo;s development and writing were divorced from my viewing of it. I know that, at the end of its run, Veep kind of ran into the unexpected insanity Trump\u0026rsquo;s presidency injected into American politics. In that sense, it\u0026rsquo;s very understandable that the show felt the need to ramp up in ridiculousness come season 7. I just wish it had done so a little more gradually, and with the depth and nuance that the earlier seasons were so good at.\nI would be remiss to mention that I learned the writing team shifted around season 5, which makes complete sense when you stop and think about it. Kind of a shame\u0026hellip;\nLike many, I\u0026rsquo;m sure, my favorite character is Richard. As someone who loves Netflix\u0026rsquo;s I Think You Should Leave, I was delighted when Sam Richardson joined the show. His comedic timing is phenomenal, and Richard\u0026rsquo;s brand of cluelessness was a much-needed addition to the cast dynamic. That said, I do realize that the show kind of started revolving around him a little too much in later seasons. At first, this was fine\u0026hellip; but after some time it became a little tiresome (this was definitely a writing problem and not Sam Richardson\u0026rsquo;s problem).\nI also loved Gary. It kind of felt like the showrunners cast Tony Hale to play the exact same character as Arrested Development\u0026rsquo;s Buster Bluth, but somehow it works tremendously in the context of Veep. However, to give credit where it\u0026rsquo;s due, Hale was also able to deliver one of the most gripping dramatic performances of the whole show in season 4\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;East Wing.\u0026rdquo;\nOverall, I liked Veep, but I don\u0026rsquo;t think I can say I loved it. Had the show ended when season 5 ended, I might feel differently. But the final season and final episode, made me feel almost grimy with how mean-spirited and cynical they were. If you\u0026rsquo;re curious about it, I think it\u0026rsquo;s for sure worth a watch, but be warned on that last season.\nOn a final note: I really do want to emphasize that the final scene of the entire show was pretty expertly done. If anything we can all rest easy knowing that stuck the landing.\n","permalink":"https://msnws.github.io/site/posts/veep/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eJust as a note\u0026hellip; I mention incredibly light spoilers for the end of Veep, and less light spoilers for Game of Thrones below.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust finished watching \u003cem\u003eVeep\u003c/em\u003e yesterday.

You can’t half-ass an office job. You can’t half-ass paying your bills on time. If you want to make people feel comfortable in your home, you can’t half-ass things like taking out the trash or keeping your place clean.\nIt was all way too much to handle at once for me. And as my responsibilities continued to grow, I turned towards the internet for help managing my life. That’s when I first encountered the rabbit hole that I like to call the internet’s “productivity community.”\nWhat exactly is the productivity community, you might ask? Just search “productivity” on YouTube and see what comes up. Or, if you really want to go deeper down the rabbit hole, search for things like “Task Management Apps” or “Best Note Taking Apps” and, without fail, you’ll quickly notice that you see the same familiar faces, and concepts such as GTD (Getting Things Done) and Building a Second Brain.\nAt the time, this content was a revelation for me. I had never taken the time to develop solid organizational skills because I had an executive function disorder that flew under the radar. Before this, in school, I was able indulge in my own worst habits. I chronically procrastinated. I had a teacher who graded on completion and came to our desks only looking to see if we had something written down. I showed her old homework every single time.\nNow, I was learning how to take control of my life. Over the years, I became well acquainted with GTD. I started using a task management app. I closed all of my “open loops” by religiously entering them into my inbox. I diligently did my weekly reviews.\nI began taking detailed notes on things in a note-taking app. I learned the PARA method. When bi-directional linking notes together became popular, I followed suit.\nWhen I felt as though my system wasn’t suiting me, I changed things. I changed the apps I used. Then I changed them again. Then I changed them again and again and again. My productivity system had to be perfect. I had to be perfect. Why couldn’t I just do the things I was supposed to do? Clearly these systems weren’t working for me. So I had to adapt. I had to look up more videos. More articles. More guides.\nI watched videos on how to improve my focus, building habits, hacking your sleep, watching all your content on 2x speed to increase media consumption, how to purge all of your belongings, and so on and so on.\nNothing worked.\nEarly this year (2023 as I’m writing this) I was diagnosed with ADHD-PI. In the immediate aftermath of my diagnosis, seismic waves of realizations about my entire life and many of the things I’ve experienced over time washed over me. One of these realizations was that my endless pursuit of productivity and self-improvement stemmed from my undiagnosed condition.\nI can recall a a moment where I had decided I had to change my productivity system up. I obsessively picked apart GTD’s five step process in and effort understand it better. I can remember telling myself, exasperated, that Step 5 - “Engage” or “Do” was the weakest link in the system. “It doesn’t tell you how or when to actually do stuff!” I’d tell myself. “It’s so vague!”\nClearly I didn’t consider that, for most people, the part where you “do” the things on your list is the easy part of GTD.\nThis leads me to my greater point… all of these systems, productivity methods, hacks, etc. are not designed for those of us with ADHD. They’re designed for those who might struggle with organization or who might need more guidance, but not those who are struggling with executive functioning, processing difficulties or short-term memory issues.\nI also came to understand that self-proclaimed “productivity gurus” such as David Allen, Ali Abdaal, Tiago Forte, Francesco d’Alessio, Matt D’avella, Thomas Frank and many others, whether intentionally, or more likely, as a result of the dopamine fueled lotto that is social media, exist as hostile and predatory figures to the neurodiverse community.\nThese people operate by creating content that promises the viewer clarity, the ability to “get things done,” improve their thinking and creativity and, in some nefarious cases, make a great deal of money, among other things. All you have to do is take the advice they give in their videos on blind faith. Just check out this new app, try this new way of organizing yourself, connect your apps in this specific way, develop these particular habits. And then, since they’re content creators who operate in an attention-driven economy, and exploit social media patterns for their own gain, they release their next video containing new recommendations, new and better systems, and other, shiny new ways to do things ad infinitum.\nTo someone with ADHD who doesn’t know any better, like myself, this hijacks a genuine interest in improving oneself and becomes a hyper fixation that will likely only result in frustration, disappointment, perfectionism and burnout.\nI’ve since realized that productivity influencers are overrated. Especially those who don’t struggle with issues like mine. Their advice for someone like me is bogus and won’t ever stick. You mean to tell me that I should organize all of my notes into a Projects folder, Areas folder, Resources folder or Archive folder, keep those folders organized, mirror this setup in a task manager, add contexts to my tasks, prune my notes for bi-directional links all while tracking my habits in a custom kanban database in Notion? Yeah right… the minute I fall off of a system this rigid in favor of something more simplistic is the minute everything falls apart.\nI read some advice on the ADHD subreddit some time back. It said this:\n“I really think the problem with most organizational systems for people with ADHD is that other people’s systems almost never work for us. We need to build our own, and understand that the things the system is telling us to do are coming from US, not some outside authority”\nThis has become my exact position over time. Nowadays, I keep things simple. I largely use stock apps on my iPhone, iPad and MacBook and focus far more on what works for me. I try not to worry about perfection anymore. I regard all the creators in the productivity rabbit hole with disdain, whether justified or not. It doesn’t matter to me.\nLiving with ADHD sucks. It’s not easy. I’ll likely have issues forming habits, being organized or taking charge of my own life for the entirety of my life. I can recognize that and work on my problems one step at a time. I don’t need random people with expensive cameras and Skillshare money to remind me that these tendencies make things harder for me. What’s more, I definitely don’t need them to sell me their new solution of the week as though it’s some golden answer that will fix me.\n","permalink":"https://msnws.github.io/site/posts/productivity/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eJust wanted to lay out a thought that’s been bouncing around my head now for a while.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I left school and confronted the pressures and responsibilities that come with adult life, I quickly realized that my previous strategy of half-assing my life quickly wasn’t effective anymore.
