      <description>&lt;p&gt;Wow. Kind of an emotionally charged listen. As a long-time fan of the Beatles, I think &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/APJAQoSCwuA?si=jnNf0CDD8tPH0Us7&#34;&gt;the story behind this song&lt;/a&gt; is really touching, and to think that&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A) I’m able to say that I was alive when the Beatles released “new music” (something that is causing some cognitive dissonance), and&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;B) that this is being called their “final song,”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;just makes me feel a bit overwhelmed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Truth be told, as a song, I would mostly say it was fine. I would probably consider it a less standout track for the Beatles had it been included on any of their previous albums. That said, it&amp;rsquo;s still a Beatles song, so it still holds some merit to me, and I think there’s a tremendous amount of weight behind the song all the same.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
