      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hey everyone! I&amp;rsquo;m currently moving my blog over to Hugo as opposed to write.bz. I like write.bz, and while it might be tough losing federation, I think that this is the best move for the blog moving forward. I&amp;rsquo;ll be moving all of my posts over at some point in the near term future.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>An Introductory Post</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bear with me since this is my first blog post. I’ll try to keep it short and sweet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My name is Mason. I’m a creative living in Chicago. I use the vague word “creative” here because I’m a bit of a Jack of all trades, master of none. Basically, my ideas to output ratio is very low (likely as a result of my ADHD). A lot of different mediums resonate with me, but I have trouble seeing things through. Obviously I’m learning to change that, and I even independently released my first EP of produced music a couple of months ago! It’s all a work in progress.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
